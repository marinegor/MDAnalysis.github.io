title: Google Summer of Code Students 2022
---

We are happy to announce that MDAnalysis is hosting two [GSoC][gsoc] students this year - @xhgchen and @marinegor. MDAnalysis has been accepted as its own [organization with GSoC][mda-gsoc] for the fourth year running, and we are grateful to Google for granting us the opportunity to get started on _two_ very exciting GSoC projects!

## Xu Hong Chen: Add calculations for self-diffusivity and viscosity

Write something about your project and yourself here (don't forget to link to the project page on the GSoC website)!

Add where we can find you here! (github, twitter, others)

## Egor Marin: Implementation of parallel analysis in MDAnalysis

Even though MDAnalysis (since 2.0) allows for serialization of almost all fundamental components, it still lacks a seamless way to run analysis of trajectories in a parallel fashion. For his Summer of Code project, Egor will be implementing a parallel-ready backend for MDAnalysis, hoping that it will increase the speed and accessibility of large-scale molecular dynamics analysis.

Egor will hopefully graduate this year fom the PhD program of the Univesrity of Groningen (Netherlands). His main expertise lies in structural biology, as can be seen by his [work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FJbv9XcAAAAJ) during his bachelors and masters. Apart from that, he does a lot of computer administration work, and enjoys occasional bouldering and snowboarding.

You can find Egor on [github](https://github.com/marinegor) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/egor__marin), if necessary.
